<h5 class="">CAUSES OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (GBV)</h5>
<P class="justify"> 1. <b>Uneven access to education:</b>
    Around the world, women still have less access to education than men. ¼ of young women between 15-24 will not finish primary school. That group makes up 58% of the people not completing that basic education. Of all the illiterate people in the world, ⅔ are women. When girls are not educated on the same level as boys, it has a huge effect on their future and the kinds of opportunities they'll get.</P>
    <p class="justfy">2.<b> Lack of employment equality:</b>
        Only 6 countries in the world give women the same legal work rights as men. In fact, most economies give women only ¾ the rights of men. Studies show that if employment became a more even playing field, it has a positive domino effect on other areas prone to gender inequality.</p>
        <p class="justify">3. <b>Job segregation:</b>
            One of the causes for gender inequality within employment is the division of jobs. In most societies, there's an inherent belief that men are simply better equipped to handle certain jobs. Most of the time, those are the jobs that pay the best. This discrimination results in lower income for women. Women also take on the primary responsibility for unpaid labor, so even as they participate in the paid workforce, they have extra work that never gets recognized financially.</p>
            <p class="justify">4. <b>Lack of legal protections:</b>
                According to research from the World Bank, over one billion women don’t have legal protection against domestic sexual violence or domestic economic violence. Both have a significant impact on women’s ability to thrive and live in freedom. In many countries, there’s also a lack of legal protections against harassment in the workplace, at school, and in public. These places become unsafe and without protection, women frequently have to make decisions that compromise and limit their goals.</p>
                <p class="justify">5. <b>Lack of bodily autonomy:</b>
                    Many women around the world do not have authority over their own bodies or when they become parents. Accessing birth control is frequently very difficult. According to the World Health Organization, over 200 million women who don’t want to get pregnant are not using contraception. There are various reasons for this such as a lack of options, limited access, and cultural/religious opposition. On a global scale, about 40% of pregnancies are not planned and while 50% of them do end in abortion, 38% result in births. These mothers often become financially dependent on another person or the state, losing their freedom.</p>

                <h5 class="">Here are some effect of gender based violence (GBV)</h5>
                <p class="justify"> 1.<b> What are the effects of GBV on girls?:</b>
                    Women and girls may experience severe physical injuries, unwanted pregnancies and exposure to HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the limited ability to complete daily tasks, and suicidal thoughts are also common.</p>
                    <p class="justify"> 2. Gender-based violence produces a variety of negative impacts for both the individual and the community, including chronic illnesses, poor mental health, decreased sexual and reproductive health, physical injury, and even death.</p>
                    <p class="justify"> 3. 
                        GBV also causes psychological trauma such as fear, anxiety, self-blame, depression and suicidal thoughts.</p>
                        <p class="justify"> 4. 
                            Mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidality, and chronic mental illness. Intimate partner violence affects both men and women, but women are more likely to experience severe victimization.</p>
                            <p class="justify"> 5. Traumatic childhood events can change the way a person's brain and body work. Trauma can affect the person's emotions, memory, thinking and sense of self. Trauma can also affect relationships. Women most often develop the effects of trauma if, as children, they felt helpless and trapped by abuse.
